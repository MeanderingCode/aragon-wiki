Start livestream in Jitsi when the meeting is scheduled to start.

Welcome viewers and participants on the call. “Before we begin..” Designate a note taker if one has not volunteered already.
 - Document meeting attendees, agenda items, notes from discussions.

Do roll call and have everyone say a quick introduction of who they are.

Run through each agenda item and pass to item owner to lead. Conclude each item discussion by repeating action items.

Keep meeting running on time. The goal is to have all agenda items addressed by the scheduled end time.

If all agenda items are covered before the scheduled end time, the meeting is done early.

Thank participants and viewers for attending, then stop the livestream.

Upload notes and video recording link to wiki.

Create an [issue](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/issues) in the wiki to make a backup of the video recording.
